# Project summary

Around the clock, telescopes affixed to orbital satellites and ground-based observatories are taking millions of pictures of millions upon millions of celestial bodies. These data, of stars, planets and galaxies provide an invaluable resource to astronomers.

However, there is a bottleneck: until the data is annotated, itâ€™s incredibly difficult for scientists to put it to good use. Additionally, scientists are usually interested in subsets of the data, like galaxies with unique characteristics.

In this project, I will build a neural network to classify deep-space galaxies. I will be using image data curated by Galaxy Zoo, a crowd-sourced project devoted to annotating galaxies in support of scientific discovery.

I will identify "odd" properties of galaxies. The data falls into four classes:

1. Galaxies with no identifying characteristics.
2. Galaxies with rings.
3. Galactic mergers.
4. "Other", Irregular celestial bodies.
